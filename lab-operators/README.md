## Lab operators

### Arithmetic Operators

1. Create a class called `MathematicalOperators`
2. Create a basic `main` method
3. Create two variables of type `int`; assign them a static final value
4. Take each of the two values
5. Add the two variables and print out the results to the console
6. Subtract the two variables and print out the results to the console
7. Subtract the two variables getting a negative result and print out the result to the console
8. Multiply the two variables and print out the results to the console
9. Divide the two variables, assuming they are not divisible with the remainder of 0, what is printed out?
10. Is the value `int` the previous step still an `int`?

### Relational Operators

1. Create a class called `RelationalOperators`
2. Create a basic `main` method
3. Create two variables of type `int`; assign them a static final value; make the second one 100 more than the first
4. Create two more variables of type `int`; assign them a static final value; make the second one 100 more than the first
5. Take each of the two values and compare with the `equality` operator
6. Print out the result. What primitive type are you printing out? 
7. Compare the first two variables against each other; is the first less than the second?
8. Compare the first two variables against each other; is the greater less than the second?
9. Compare the first two variables against each other; is the first less or equal than the second?
10. Compare the first two variables against each other; is the first greater or equal than the second?

### Relational Operators

1. Create a class called `LogicalOperators`
2. Create a basic `main` method
3. Create two variables of type `int`; assign them a static final value; make the second one 100 more than the first
4. Create one variable of type `boolean`; call it `isVaccinated`
5. Set the boolean to be `true`
6. Create an if statement and if the first variable is less than second AND `isVaccinated` is true then print out "LESS AND Vaccinated"
7. Create an if statement and if the first variable is less than second OR `isVaccinated` is true then print out "LESS OR Vaccinated"
8. Print out "NOT VACCINATED" if  `isVaccinated` is true
9. Flip the value of `isVaccinated` in the next line
10. Print out the value of `isVaccinated`. Is the value the opposite of the previous step?

### Assignment Operator ++[var]

1. Create a class called `AssignmentOperators`
2. Create a basic `main` method
3. Create two variables of type `int`, call them `x` and `y`
4. Set the value of the first variable to `100`
5. Do not set a value for the second variable
6. Print out the value of the first variable
7. Assign the [second variable] to be the same value as ++[first variable]
8. hint y = ++x
9. Print out the value of `x`
10. Print out the value of `y`
11. How does `y` compare to the initial value of `x`?
12. What is the current value of `y`?

### Repeat for Assignment Operator [var]++
1. Repeat the above exercise but instead
2. Assign the [second variable] to be the same value as [first variable]++
3. hint the incrementor is on the right side
4. Answer the same questions
