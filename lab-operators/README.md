## Lab Basics

The lab overview:

Review the code in the <code>Precedence</code> class and review the results. Specifically, run  
the main in the classes and review the actual results with your expected results.

In IntelliJ, highlight the class and then right mouse on it. Choose the "Run Precedence.main()" option.
